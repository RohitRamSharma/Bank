# Bank_customer_segmentation
The objective of this project is to segment the bank customers into multiple groups and to analyse the results when no labels are given for features.
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer dataset into specific groups based on shared traits. Most banks have a large customer base - with different characteristics in terms of age, income, values, lifestyle, and more. 
### Dataset
The dataset consists of 1 Million+ transaction by over 800K customers for a bank in India. The data contains information such as - customer age (DOB), location, gender, account balance at the time of the transaction, transaction details, transaction amount, etc.
