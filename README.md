# Bank_customer_segmentation
The objective of this project is to segment the bank customers into multiple groups and to analyse the results when no labels are given for features.
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer dataset into specific groups based on shared traits. Most banks have a large customer base - with different characteristics in terms of age, income, values, lifestyle, and more. 

• Executed data visualization (histogram, pie chart, box plot) to get a good idea regarding the features in data 

• Performed K Means clustering, implemented Elbow technique & Silhoutte score method after data analysis 

• Applied Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN algorithm and got 3 optimal number of clusteres on the given data
### Dataset
The dataset consists of 1 Million+ transaction by over 800K customers for a bank in India. The data contains information such as - customer age (DOB), location, gender, account balance at the time of the transaction, transaction details, transaction amount, etc.
